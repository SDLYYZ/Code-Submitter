### Requirements
+ PHP
+ `php-curl` extension
+ `curl` installed and set in `PATH`

### Tips
It does not depend on database, actually it almost store nothing on the server — except the temporary files generated by PHP when some files are uploaded.  
Modify `config.php` to make some changes. You can use it outside with another URL, please modify the boolean variable `$OUTSIDE` to .  
`$INT_BASEURL` means the SYZOJ home page's URL in the internal network. `$EXT_BASEURL` means the one in the public network.  
Please change `$contest` to your contest ID. And change `$ids` array according to your problems' filename and real index in the problem set.  

You can configure SYZOJ-Web to listen on `127.0.0.1` and use this utility to submit. It's recommended to avoid cheating by this way.
